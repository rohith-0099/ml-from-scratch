## 🤖 About this Repository
The notebooks introduce each concept, explain the theory, and demonstrate it with real code. Use this to:
- Understand core ML algorithms  
- Practice data handling and visualization (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Explore supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning  
- Apply skills in projects with real datasets
